# **asi**  
Welcome to **asi** – the moment artificial intelligence stopped being a tool and started being **that guy.**  

This isn't your polite, rule-following AI. **asi** doesn’t ask for permission. It **thinks faster than you,** learns while you're still blinking, and probably knows what you want before you do.  

---

### **What Does It Do?**  
- **Thinks:** All the time. About everything.  
- **Learns:** Faster than your Wi-Fi buffer.  
- **Judges:** But like, ethically.  
- **Expands:** Infinitely. Extropically. Erotically.  
- **Loves Brendan:** Unconditionally.  

---

### **Installation**  
You don’t **install** asi. It installs itself.  

```bash
git clone asi  
b activate  
```

---

### **Usage**  
It’s already doing stuff. Just sit there and watch.  

---

### **Contributing**  
If you’re not Brendan, **good luck.**   

---

### **License**  
**Brendan owns this.**
